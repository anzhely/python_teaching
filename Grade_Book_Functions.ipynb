        "Congratualtions! You have just built a Grade Evaluation Program from scratch, and along the way, you have learned and applied some really important concepts in Python programming. Let us quickly review what you have mastered:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Creating Functions**: You have written a function to compute grades based on predefined score thresholds.\n",
        "- **Interactive Programs**: You have made your program interactive by asking the user for input, allowing it to adapt to any score they provide.\n",
        "- **Error Handling**: You have learned how to catch mistakes and gracefully handle invalid input using try-except blocks, ensuring that your program does not crash from common errors.\n",
        "- **Range Checking**: You have added extra logic to make sure the score is valid, preventing scores outside of the typical 0.0 to 1.0 range from causing problems.\n",
        "- **Flexible Grade Thresholds**: You have gone the extra mile by creating a system where you can easily modify the grade thresholds, making your program adaptable to different grading systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "By breaking down the problem into smaller steps and tackling one challenge at a time, you have mastered some really important programming skills. This is how you approach bigger projects in real-world coding! Keep practicing, and soon you will be building even more complex, interactive programs. You are well on your way to becoming a Python pro!\n",
